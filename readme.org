* Overview
** ellm.el
ellm.el provides an interactive shell for chatting with a Large
Language Model (LLM), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, directly from
Emacs. It leverages Emacsâ€™s built-in `comint-mode` for an interactive
REPL-like experience (with prompt, history, etc.) and uses Emacs's
built-in URL and JSON libraries to communicate with the OpenAI
APIâ€”without relying on any external dependencies.

** Features
- *Interactive Chat:* Dedicated chat buffer with prompt and history.
- *Multi-turn Conversations:* Maintains conversation history and sends it with each API request.
- *Minimal Dependencies:* Built entirely with Emacs native libraries (`comint` and `json`).
- *Customizable:* Easily configure the API key, model, system prompt, and welcome message through Emacs customization.

** Installation
1. *Download the Package:*
   Save the file `ellm.el` in your Emacs load-path (for example, in `~/.emacs.d/lisp/`).

2. *Load the Package:*
   Add the following lines to your Emacs init file (e.g., `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`):


   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
   (require 'ellm)
   #+END_SRC

** Configuration
Before using ellm.el, set your OpenAI API key in your Emacs init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ellm-api-key "YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY")
#+END_SRC

You can also customize other options:

- *ellm-model:*
  Specify the model to use (default is `"chatgpt-4o-latest"` in this minimal implementation). For example:


  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ellm-model "gpt-3.5-turbo")  ;; or any other model you wish to use
  #+END_SRC

- ellm-system-message:
  This message is sent as the system prompt to the LLM at the start of the conversation.


  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ellm-system-message "You use markdown liberally to structure responses. Always show code snippets in markdown blocks with language labels.")
  #+END_SRC

- *ellm-welcome-message:*
  The welcome message is displayed in the chat buffer when you start a session (it is not sent as part of the payload).


  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ellm-welcome-message "ðŸ’¬ ElLM is ready! Type your prompt and press Enter. (Type 'clear' to reset.)")
  #+END_SRC
